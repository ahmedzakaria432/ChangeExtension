# ChangeExtension
i programmed these tools to help me to change asp extension to html in downloaded files of w3School files and change contents of them to make next ,back buttons and links work and open html files.

first i downloaded w3school website files to open website offline and i found that when i open any file i is not work because their extension was asp  so i decided to program some tools to help me in this problem 

the first tool "Change Extension": it changes extension of files from asp to html
the second tool "Change Asp In Page": it reads html files and replace all occurances of asp to html to make buttons like next and back work correctly and links in side menue work
